  - Implement feedback mechanisms
  - Add playlist requests functionality

## Technical Debt

- **Code Refactoring**
  - Break down large methods into smaller ones
  - Standardize error handling patterns
  - Improve type hinting and documentation

- **Configuration Management**
  - Add schema validation for configuration
  - Support for environment variables
  - Implement configuration profiles

- **Testing Infrastructure**
  - Add mock services for testing
  - Implement test data generators
  - Create performance testing suite

## Performance Improvements

Based on code analysis, the following performance optimizations are recommended:

### 1. Asynchronous Processing
- Replace blocking `asyncio.sleep()` calls with non-blocking alternatives
- Use `asyncio.gather()` to parallelize independent operations (playlist updates, history updates, social media posts)
- Move CPU-intensive operations to thread pools
- Implement proper timeout handling for all network and I/O operations

### 2. Database Optimizations
- Implement connection pooling using aiosqlite
- Use prepared statements for frequently executed queries
- Add indexes for commonly searched fields
- Implement batch operations for multiple inserts/updates
- Cache database query results with appropriate TTL values
- Use transactions for related operations

### 3. Caching Strategies
- Cache processed artwork with hash-based lookups
- Implement LRU caches for social media post frequency checks
- Cache API authentication tokens and refresh only when needed
- Store pre-computed artist/track hashes
- Cache configuration validation results

### 4. Image Processing Improvements
- Move image processing to a separate thread pool
- Implement progressive image loading/processing
- Optimize artwork hash generation algorithm
- Use more efficient image libraries or consider GPU acceleration for resizing
- Implement smarter cleanup that doesn't scan all files on each operation

### 5. Social Media Optimizations
- Maintain persistent client sessions rather than creating new ones
- Pre-compile regex patterns for hashtag extraction
- Parallelize posts to different platforms using `asyncio.gather()`
- Implement better retry logic with exponential backoff
- Optimize rate limiting to avoid unnecessary waits

### 6. Memory Management
- Limit in-memory history sizes with configurable bounds
- Implement proper cleanup for temporary files and images
- Use generators for processing large datasets
- Implement resource limits to prevent memory exhaustion
- Consider weak references for large objects

### 7. Socket Server Improvements
- Implement backpressure handling for connection overload
- Add proper socket timeout settings
- Use streaming parsers for large JSON payloads
- Implement proper connection pooling

### 8. Monitoring and Profiling
- Add performance metrics for key operations
- Track memory usage throughout execution
- Implement operation timing to identify bottlenecks
- Set up alerting for performance degradation

These improvements would significantly enhance the system's efficiency, reduce resource usage, and improve overall responsiveness while maintaining the same functionality.
