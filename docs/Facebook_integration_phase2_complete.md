# Facebook Integration Enhancement - Phase 2 Complete

We have successfully implemented Phase 2 of the Facebook integration enhancement plan, which focuses on content generation and image support. This phase builds on the foundation established in Phase 1 (configuration and setup) and Phase 1.5 (token validation and management).

## Completed Tasks

### 1. AI Content Generation Integration

Updated the `update_facebook()` method to support AI-enhanced content:

```python
if self.fb_enable_ai:
    post_text, content_metadata = await self.content_generator.generate_track_description(track)
    content_source = content_metadata.get("source_type", "unknown")
    if content_source == "ai":
        source_details = content_metadata.get("prompt_name", "unknown")
    else:
        source_details = content_metadata.get("template_name", "unknown")
else:
    # Use standard text if AI is disabled
    post_text = f"üéµ Now Playing on Now Wave Radio:\n{track.artist} - {track.title}"
    # Add additional track info...
```

This implementation:
- Reuses the existing ContentGenerator to create AI-enhanced posts
- Tracks content source information (AI vs template)
- Properly handles both AI and template-based content options
- Uses the same prompt system as Bluesky for consistency

### 2. Image Attachment Support

Enhanced image attachment functionality:

```python
if self.fb_enable_images:
    # Get artwork path
    artwork_path = self.artwork_manager.publish_dir / track.image
    
    # Resize image for Facebook
    temp_resized, dimensions = await self.artwork_manager.resize_for_social(
        image_path,
        size=(self.fb_image_width, self.fb_image_height),
    )
    
    # Post with image
    with open(upload_path, "rb") as image_file:
        response = await self._facebook_api_call_with_retry(
            self.facebook.put_photo,
            image=image_file,
            message=post_text,
            album_path=f"{self.fb_page_id}/photos"
        )
```

This implementation:
- Resizes artwork using the same ArtworkManager as Bluesky
- Supports Facebook's recommended image dimensions
- Cleans up temporary files after posting
- Properly handles failed image uploads by falling back to text posts

### 3. Hashtag Support

Added Facebook-specific hashtag processing:

```python
# Generate system hashtags - pass content source info
is_ai_content = content_source == "ai"
system_hashtags = self.content_generator.generate_hashtags(
    track, is_ai_content=is_ai_content
)

# Add show name as final hashtag if it exists
if track.program and track.program.strip():
    show_hashtag = "#" + "".join(
        word.capitalize() for word in track.program.strip().split()
    )
    if show_hashtag not in system_hashtags:
        system_hashtags = system_hashtags + " " + show_hashtag
```

This implementation:
- Uses the same hashtag generation logic as Bluesky
- Deduplicates hashtags to avoid repetition
- Respects AI-generated content which may already contain hashtags
- Adds program name as a hashtag when available

### 4. Post Request Retry Logic

Implemented a robust retry mechanism for Facebook API calls:

```python
async def _facebook_api_call_with_retry(self, api_method, *args, **kwargs):
    """Execute a Facebook API call with retry logic."""
    max_retries = 3
    retry_delay = 2  # seconds
    
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            return api_method(*args, **kwargs)
        except Exception as e:
            if "rate limit" in str(e).lower():
                # Rate limit hit
                wait_time = retry_delay * (2 ** attempt)
                logging.warning(f"‚ö†Ô∏è Facebook rate limit hit, retrying in {wait_time}s")
                await asyncio.sleep(wait_time)
            elif attempt < max_retries - 1:
                # Other error, retry
                logging.warning(f"‚ö†Ô∏è Facebook API error, retrying: {e}")
                await asyncio.sleep(retry_delay)
            else:
                # Final attempt failed
                raise
```

This enhancement:
- Adds exponential backoff for rate limit errors
- Retries on transient Facebook API issues
- Provides detailed error logging
- Makes API calls more robust against temporary failures

### 5. Analytics Integration

Enhanced analytics tracking for Facebook posts:

```python
# Extract post ID from response
if isinstance(response, dict) and "id" in response:
    post_id = response["id"]
    post_url = f"https://facebook.com/{post_id}"
else:
    # Generate synthetic ID for tracking
    post_id = f"fb_{datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d%H%M%S')}"
    post_url = None

# Track post in analytics
await self.analytics.record_post(
    platform="Facebook",
    post_id=post_id,
    track=track,
    content=post_text,
    post_url=post_url,
    has_image=post_with_image
)
```

This implementation:
- Records real Facebook post IDs when available
- Stores post content and image status
- Tracks the post URL for later reference
- Properly handles error conditions

### 6. Testing Tools

Added testing utilities to verify Facebook integration:

```python
# utils/test_facebook.py
# Run with: python utils/test_facebook.py --config /path/to/config.ini
```

This test script:
- Creates a test track with sample data
- Validates Facebook credentials
- Posts a test track to Facebook
- Checks engagement metrics
- Displays analytics results

## Benefits

1. **Enhanced User Engagement**: Rich, AI-generated content with album artwork creates more engaging posts
2. **Content Consistency**: Same content generation approach as Bluesky ensures uniform social presence
3. **Error Resilience**: Robust retry logic handles API failures gracefully
4. **Analytics Integration**: Complete tracking of posts, content, and engagement metrics
5. **Better Testing**: New test utilities make it easier to verify Facebook integration

## Next Steps

With Phase 2 complete, we can now move on to the remaining phases:

### Phase 3: Real-time Engagement Tracking
- Implement real-time engagement metrics collection
- Update analytics to track engagement over time
- Create engagement comparison reports

### Phase 4: Advanced Error Handling
