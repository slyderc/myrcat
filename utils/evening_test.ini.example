# Simulate evening time (8 PM)
# Valid values: 0-23 (representing hours of the day)
# Different time segments that trigger specific prompts:
#  Morning: 5-9 (5:00 AM - 9:59 AM)
#  Daytime: 10-14 (10:00 AM - 2:59 PM)
#  Afternoon: 15-18 (3:00 PM - 6:59 PM)
#  Evening: 19-22 (7:00 PM - 10:59 PM)
#  Late Night: 23-4 (11:00 PM - 4:59 AM)
#
# NOTE: Prompt selection priority:
# 1. Program-specific prompt (e.g., "evening_vibes.txt" for "Evening Vibes" program)
# 2. Time-based prompt (e.g., "evening.txt" for 8 PM)
# 3. Default prompt ("default.txt")
#
# To test time-based prompts directly, either:
# - Remove the "program" field from the [track] section, or
# - Ensure there's no prompt file matching the program name
