## testprompt.py

A utility to test AI prompts for social media posts without posting to social platforms.

### Purpose

This utility allows you to test how different track metadata and prompts generate social media posts, helping to refine prompt templates for better results. It uses the same code as the main application for prompt selection, AI calls, and content generation, ensuring that what you see in the test will match what will be posted in production.

### Features

- Uses the same prompt selection logic as the main application
- Makes real API calls to Claude for authentic results
- Displays formatted sample posts with hashtags
- Shows statistics about the generated post
- Pulls track information from a configuration file
- Doesn't post to any social media platforms

### Usage

1. Copy the sample configuration file:

```bash
cp utils/testprompt.ini.example utils/myconfig.ini
```

2. Edit the configuration file to add your API key and customize track information:

```bash
nano utils/myconfig.ini
```

3. Run the utility:

```bash
./utils/testprompt.py -c utils/myconfig.ini
```

### Configuration

The configuration file includes:

- `[track]` section: Track metadata (artist, title, album, etc.)
- `[ai_content]` section: AI service settings (API key, model, etc.)
- `[bluesky]` section: Formatting settings (used for hashtag generation)
- `[publish_exceptions]` section: Ensures no actual posts are made
