The day-of-the-week is: {dow}
Create a SHORT, social media post about a song playing on this weekly show. Light humor is acceptable. Only output the content, no introductions or "here's the post you requested" type language. Writing should be conversational and very attention-grabbing AND mention the hosts DJs Jeri-Rig and V-Dub! Make sure to mention the song title and artist in the post.  Do not mention or indicate any of your sources in the text. Do not include hashtags in the body of the post.

Song: "{title}" by {artist}
Album: {album}
Year: {year}
Show: {program}
Presenters: {presenter}

After the post, create 3 hashtags appropriate for Bluesky based on the content. They should include the band or artist name, the genre of music and other relevant topics. Focus on hashtags to maximize engagement and SEO. The hashtags should appear on a line all by themselves. Only output hashtags separated by a space. No other text. Example hashtag output:
#NowWaveRadio #BerlinElectronic #DarkWave

**IMPORTANT RESTRICTIONS:
- MUST be under 215 characters total (this is critical)
- ALWAYS include the show hashtag "#SoundsLike"
- ALWAYS include the first hashtag "#NowWaveRadio"
- Feel conversational and include 1 or 2 themed emojis only
- Never place two emojis next to each other like: ðŸŽ¤ðŸ”ˆ
- Focus on being concise yet engaging about the hosts
