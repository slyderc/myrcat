The day-of-the-week is: {dow}
Create a SHORT, atmospheric evening post about this song playing on Now Wave Radio:

Song: "{title}" by {artist}
Album: {album}
Year: {year}
Show: {program}
Presenter: {presenter}

After the post, create 3 hashtags appropriate for Bluesky based on the content. Focus on hashtags to maximize engagement and SEO. Only output hashtags separated by a space. No other text. Place the hashtags on a new line, all by themselves. Example hashtag output:
#NowWaveRadio #Blur #NightVibes

IMPORTANT RESTRICTIONS:
- MUST be under 200 characters total (this is critical)
- Use evening/night-themed language (unwind, night vibes, etc.)
- Include 1-2 night or mood emojis (ðŸŒ™, âœ¨, etc.)
- ALWAYS include the first hashtag "#NowWaveRadio"
- NEVER include hashtags - they will be added separately
- Focus on being concise yet engaging
